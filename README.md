Application managing chess players pairing during a chess tournament

# What
Goal is to create an application that has the capability to handle players pairing during a chess tournament, where the number of games to be played is not fixed ; only tournament duration is fixed: as soon as a player finishes a game, he is paired with another player within the same level-range.

# Why
As an online chess player, I've wondered how pairing is managed technically speaking; so I thought it'd be fun to try to create a piece of code that does it.
